# Tutorial ideas :

## Datasets

### Basic data
 - [ ] (Macéo) Sklearn digits (splitting dataset cf python notebook on github)
 - [ ] add some variations to images(cf nougat article)
 - [ ] custom datasets using sklearn
 - [ ] Transforming images to usable array
 - [ ] (Louison) Using .xls document
 - [ ] Basic use of datatbase (from .txt file or binary file)

### Pandas 
 - [ ] Explain dataframes
 - [ ] How to read data from csv
 - [ ] How to write data in csv
 - [ ] How to use the data
 - [ ] How to visualize data
 - [ ] How to deal with missing features
 - [ ] How to discover data : main caracteristics

### More advanced use of data
 - [ ] What is JSON files and how to use them 
 - [ ] Download and use data from huggin face
 - [ ] What are the convention to organize a projet in datascience in order to have juste a clean project, the goal is not to have the best commented and tested project (how to separate files, between training, evaluation and how to name files : what name for saved model)
 - [ ] Data augmentation



## IDK
 - [ ] Pytorch: Do better than https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html
 - [ ] Tensors 
 - [ ] Data loader 
 - [ ] Optimizer 
 - [ ] Save model 



## Machine Learning theory :
 - [ ] (Macéo) Genetics algorithm
 - [ ] Using existing models from hugging faces (Solving problem for GPU drivers/ GPUless computer)
 - [ ] (Louison) Why it will not work : Curse of dimensionnality 
 - [ ] (Louison) Why it will work : symetries of the problem
 - [ ] (Louison) Neural networks : Universality theorem
 - [ ] Classifier
 - [ ] Convolutionnal networks
 - [ ] Pitfalls of other models, ex: RNNs
 - [ ] Transformers
 - [ ] OCR
 - [ ] Tokens / Tokenizer
 - [ ] Why GPU compute faster than CPU ?
 - [ ] (Macéo) Digit recognition -> Logistic regression
 - [ ] Encoder / decoder ?
 - [ ] How do handle massive data ? (Download millions of arxiv articles and process them for example compute the mean of number of caracters or whatever)
 - [ ] Levenshtein distance, Recall , Accuracy, F1, etc(intro to metrics)
 - [ ] How to do predict the complexity of a model depending on the data structure you use, how you read the data, the optimizer, the number of layers of a neural networks...
