# Next steps

 -[ ] Improve model's performances.
 -[ ] Find best hyper-parameters (maybe by using genetic algorithms).
 -[ ] Train model on even more data.
 -[ ] Finetune the model to create an other one for handwritten formula.
 -[ ] Improve model to entire PDFs by splitting part of PDFs and applying each relevant model to associated parts.
